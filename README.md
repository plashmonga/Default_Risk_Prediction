# Default_Risk_Prediction
This algorithm can predict people described by a set of attributes will have good or bad credit risks

The data for this problem is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)). 

#### Approach
* EDA
* Correlation between these categorical variables and the response variable
* Machine Learning algorithms to select best model for classification customers into good or bad credit.
